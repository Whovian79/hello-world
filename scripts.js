// PRIMITIVE data

//We need a way to reuse or access data, so we create a REFERENCE.
//'const' alerts JS to reserve some space in memory
//We provide a name for this space in memory
// We use the ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR '='
//THIS TAKES THE VALUE on the right and assigns to the NAME REFERENCE.
const myString = "strinadfasdfdsag";
// Use 'let' ONLY if we plan to RE=ASSINGN  the VALUE REFERENCED by the VARIABLE
let myNum = 23;

// myStringIsThis = "something else";

//homework 29 January
const species = "Time Lord";
let currentRegen = null;
currentRegen = 4;

//3 primitive data types
//string
("supercalafragalisticexpialadocious");
//number
let myPayRate = 3.14;
//boolean
//I understand this is true and false (if/then) I just can't think of a good example right now...
